# About

Suggestions+ is a new system of suggestions. It allows users to not just submit a simple text suggestion, but much more than that. Suggestions+ has title *and* description, and *custom options*. Custom options allows users to not just be stuck with a simple like/dislike, but to input up to 5 of their own options per suggestion. This is configurable, and can be turned off completely.

It also has more suggestion feedback features. It not only has Approve, Deny, and Consider, but also Reject and In Progress, along with a custom status. This allows for more options when it comes to sending feedback about a suggestion.

Speaking of feedback, there's also a mini-feedback system as well. With the /feedback command, users can send feedback about the server, or a specific server feature. This also has a title, description, and an optional rating 0 to 5.
